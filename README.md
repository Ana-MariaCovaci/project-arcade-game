## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player(a pretty Princess) and Enemies (Bugs).
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down.
Once the player collides with an enemy, the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How To Play
Use the keyboard arrows to move the character.
